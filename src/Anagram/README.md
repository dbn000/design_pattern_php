Given two strings, check if theyâ€™re anagrams or not. Two strings are anagrams
if they are written using the same exact letters, ignoring space, punctuation
and capitalization. Each letter should have the same count in both strings. 

For example:

"Mother In Law" and "Hitler Woman" are anagrams.
"Debit Card" and "Bad Credit" are anagrams.
